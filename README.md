# ME592_Homework03

File Homework03_V1_correlation.ipynb is plotting data, finding the extreme data point and check the correlation between each data.
File Homework03_PVKW_HuberLoss_1.ipynb, Homework03_PVKW_MEANABS_ERROR.ipynb, Homework03_PVKW_MEANABS_ERROR_2.ipynb, and Homework03_PVKW_MSE_1.ipynb train the model with whole year data, tested with different model(LSTM and GRU), and different error function.
File Homework03_V8_MIMO.ipynb, Homework03_V8_MISO_PV.ipynb, and Homework03_V8_MISO_TB.ipynb focus on training and predict the data only using the 2011 Spring season period. Tried using different layer (LSTM, GRU) and plot the result.
File Homework03_V9_MIMO_errorfunc.ipynb applied different error function in the model and do the comparison.
